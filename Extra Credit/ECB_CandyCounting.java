/*
The neighbor kid from across the street is taking stock of her trick-or-treating
haul. She has drafted you as her accountant. She pulls each piece of candy out
of her bucket one at a time and tells you what it is. Your job is to let her know
which type of candy she has the most of.

Input: The input will begin with a positive integer representing the number of
pieces of candy, n <= 100. The next n lines will contain the name of each type of
candy, one per line.

Output: The output should be the name of the type of candy that appears
most frequently in the list. There will always be a single type of candy that
appears most frequently (i.e. there will never be any “ties”).
