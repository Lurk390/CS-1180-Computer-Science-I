/*
Design but do not implement a Tic-Tac-Toe program that meets the requirements listed below. Your
design should include a list of classes. For each class, you should list its fields (access modifier, data type,
and name) and methods (access modifier, return type, name, and parameter list). You should also
provide extensive comments for each field and method. For fields, state their intended purpose and
valid values (for example, “this field stores the user’s score; it must be greater than or equal to zero”)
and for methods, state what each parameter should contain, any preconditions for the method to
operate correctly, what the method should do, what it will return, and any postconditions (i.e. things
that are true after the method completes). Note that not all methods will have all of these things (i.e. it
is possible that a method does not have any preconditions). Remember that a good Java method is like a
good English paragraph — it should do/say one thing well. Also remember to enforce the object-
oriented principles of encapsulation and reusing code wherever possible rather than duplicating it. You
may turn in either a PDF with your design or Java code stubs and comments.

TicTacToe Requirements

Support for one human and one computer player or two human players
Keep track of players’ win-loss-tie records between program executions (e.g. by persisting data in a file).
Display a list of the top ten best records when the game starts up.
Randomly select one of the players to choose their symbol (X or O)
Standard TicTacToe rules apply (X moves first, players alternate turns, you can’t move to a square that is
already occupied, three in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins)
When the game ends, the result is announced, players’ records are updated, and the user(s) are asked if
they want to play again
